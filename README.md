# Codegen Examples

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-docs.codegen.com-blue)](https://docs.codegen.com)

This is a collection of examples using [Codegen](https://codegen.com). You can use these examples to learn how to use Codegen and integrate the codegen agent into your workflows.

## Setup

We recommend using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) with Python 3.13 for the best experience.

Install Codegen
```bash
uv pip install codegen
```

In order to use the codegen API you will need to generate a token [here](https://www.codegen.sh/token)

Your environment is now ready to use the codegen API!

## Examples

Within the examples folder, each subdirectory contains a self-contained example with:
- An explanation of the use case (`README.md`)
- Files that leverage codegen for powerful applications
